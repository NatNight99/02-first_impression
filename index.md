- Concept art and story development of an animated movie
- "The Boots Walk Quietly" is an animated short that was created in the last summer as a school project
- It’s an animated horror with the fairy tale aspects sprinkled in
- To bring the story to life, I used the drawing program Krita, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere 
- The project was left with an open ending but with a lot of illustrations left to be animated
- And for that, I have decided to continue and make this into my Bachelot work
- Watch the whole short here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIBCO0sSIc


### Cat’s life ("Under The Cat’s Weather")
- Storyboard and basic story concept
- Made as an excercise in concept and storyboard for my drawing subjects
- The story is about a family of three cat’s living their dream life, until new arrival in the personification of a small disorderly kitten arrives
- It’s basically a more serious story about harder subjects disguised as typical "animal’s adventures" popular in the 1980-1990s
- The main cast consists of:
  1. Blanka - a prideful sphynx cat who needs to learn to be confortable in her own skin
  2. Rupert - little energetic bengal kitten stealing Blanka’s spotlight and acting like a spoiled brat
  3. Claudius - an old wise male maine coon cat, trying to keep the family together while facing his own mortality
