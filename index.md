## [Featured projects](FeaturedProjects.md)

### The Boots Walk Quietly 
- Concept art and story development of an animated movie
- "The Boots Walk Quietly" is an animated short that was created in the last summer as a school project
- It’s an animated horror with the fairy tale aspects sprinkled in
- To bring the story to life, I used the drawing program Krita, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere 
- The project was left with an open ending but with a lot of illustrations left to be animated
- And for that, I have decided to continue and make this into my Bachelot work
- Watch the whole short here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIBCO0sSIc
